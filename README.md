# SMTP Client using only Sockets  
This challenge was originally posed in a school lab. Significant commenting was a requirement.

Most of the commenting is regarding the theory behind what's going on, and why I do specific things. This is to be viewed as a lab report.  

In new projects where I don't have constraints against it, I prefer to keep theory in its own documentation.
